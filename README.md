# Marxan

Some - not pretty - piece of code aimed at somewhat automating some Marxan gap analysis. The script iterage through a few planning unit sizes (200k, 20k and 5k) and through three different classification.
Everything is hard coded on the classification side and the planning unit were created through GIS software.
The status choice was hard coded as well, simply passing the conservation network shapefile directly throught the script
As said, not pretty but useful!
